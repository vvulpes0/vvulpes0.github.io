## Interests
I am a PhD student at Stony Brook University,
interested in Mathematical Linguistics.
Specifically I work with Subregular description and factorization.

## Projects
Over the years I have been building an interactive
theorem-prover for Subregular logics.
Implemented in Haskell as both a library and supporting command-line tools,
[the Language Toolkit][LTK] (LTK) enables somewhat easy translation from
constraints and automata (and, in some cases, the reverse translation).
For any Regular language, LTK can also determine
which of the simple single-relation Subregular classes
that language is in.
